It has been used in patients with portal vein invasion and to bridge patients to liver transplantation.",

  "sbrt_desc_3": "• Patients can experience worsening of liver function with SBRT and tolerance to normal liver is the main dose limiting constraint. Most safety evidence is for patients with Child-Pugh A disease. Evidence is more limited for Child-Pugh B disease and in practice treatment dose is lowered to reduce the chance of treatment toxicities.
