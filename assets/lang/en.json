  "sbrt_desc_3": "• Patients can experience worsening of liver function with SBRT and tolerance to normal liver is the main dose limiting constraint. Most safety evidence is for patients with Child-Pugh A disease. Evidence is more limited for Child-Pugh B disease and in practice treatment dose is lowered to reduce the chance of treatment toxicities. Treatment of patients with Child-Pugh C disease is not recommended as the safety of liver SBRT in this population has not been determined.",
